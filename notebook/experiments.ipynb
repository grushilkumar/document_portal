The higher \\nsecond advance estimate for economic growth in FY24, released after about eight weeks from \\nthe first estimate incorporating more updated information on the recent economic dynamics,  \\nhas bolstered the optimism about the economy. Many non-governmental expert agencies have \\nalso upped their growth projections. While consumption remained steady, r obust investment \\nactivity is driving growth. The continued focus on public investment seems to have crowded in \\nprivate investment . Strong aggregate demand has stirred manufacturing and  construction \\nactivities and accompanying professional, financial and real estate services.  \\n \\nIndia’s external account is stable despite persistent geopolitical headwinds. Merchandise trade \\ndeficit is narrowing, fuelled by falling international commodity prices. Services exports remain \\nstrong, resulting in an  increase in net services receipts.  Supported by India’s strong \\nmacroeconomic fundamentals, foreign portfolio investors have turned net buyers in February \\nwhile foreign direct investment inflows are still awaiting  momentum. The number of new \\nproject announcements remained stable, keeping India among the top 5 destinations for global \\ngreenfield projects.  \\n \\nRetail inflation remained stable and within the target range for the sixth consecutive month. \\nDriven by strong domestic growth and benign g lobal commodity prices , core inflation is \\ndeclining continuously . Timely and multi -frontal supply-side measures by the Government \\nhave also helped the cause of price stability.  \\n \\nThree recent data releases portray reassuring trends  in employment. The latest results of the \\nPeriodic Labour Force Survey indicate a decline in the unemployment rate coupled with rising \\nlabour force participation in 2023. RBI’s KLEMS database updated up to 2021-22 points to a \\nrevival of the structural transformation of the Indian labour market, with the buoyant non-farm \\nsector being able to absorb the labour force freed from farm operations.  In the organised \\nmanufacturing sector, the results of Annual Survey of Industries for FY21 and FY22 showcased \\nIndian man ufacturing sector’s resilience and its  turn-around in employment post the \\npandemic.  \\n \\nStrong growth accompanied by stable inflation and external account and progressive \\nemployment outlook help the Indian economy close the current financial year on a positive \\nnote. There are headwinds like indications of hardening crude oil prices and global supply \\nchain bottlenecks to trade. Nonetheless, India, on the whole, looks forward to a bright outlook \\nfor FY25.'),\n",

The GDP growth estimate for FY24 has been revised upwards from 7.3 per cent to 7.6 \\nper cent in the second advance estimates, highlighting the enduring strength of the Indian \\neconomy. India grew above 8 per cent for three consecutive quarters, reaffirming her position \\nas a standout performer amidst sluggish global growth trends. Various agencies echo a similar \\nsentiment revising the growth estimates of India FY24 closer to 8 percent. \\n \\nIn line with the official statistics and the upward revision of various growth estimates, SBI Research \\nand Moody’s expect GDP growth for FY24 to be 8 per cent. Fitch and Barclays raised their growth \\nforecast for FY24 to 7.8 per cent. The inclination toward s 8 per cent growth for FY24 stems from the \\nfact that the 7.6 per cent GDP growth for FY24, as estimated by the CSO, means an implied growth of \\n5.9 per cent growth for Q4 FY24, which is likely to be an understatement given the continuing \\nmomentum of the economy.  \\n \\nIndian economy witnesses strong growth momentum \\n \\n \\nSource: MoSPI \\n \\nGrowth backed by resilient investment \\n \\n2. Driven by the Government’s thrust on capex which has continued to crowd in private \\ninvestment, Gross Fixed Capital Formation (GFCF) at constant prices registered a growth of 10.2 per \\ncent in FY24 and 10.6 per cent in Q3 of FY24. There has been a broad-based pick-up in investment, as \\nreflected in the rising share of GFCF, which increased from 29.6 per cent in FY22 to 31.3 per cent of \\nGDP in FY24.  \\n \\n3. The Government’s effective capex is expected to be 4.6 per cent of GDP in FY25, as per the \\ninterim budget, which is a substantial 200 basis point increase from 2.6 per cent of GDP in FY20.

The \\nMPCE in 2022 -23 increased in real terms by 40 per cent in rural and 33.5 per cent in \\nurban areas over 2011-12.  \\n• The rural-urban divide in MPCE has also declined considerably.

Manufacturing sector registered double-digit growth in Q3 of FY24 driven by a surge \\nin investment, improved investor confidence, and strong domestic demand conditions. The \\nstrength of the manufacturing sector is also underscored by the India manufacturing PMI, \\nwhich, as of December 2023, stood at five months high of 56.9, supported by new orders and \\nfavourable demand conditions. This has been partially led by improved domestic demand and \\na decline in the inventory of finished goods. The volume indicators like the Index of Industrial \\nProduction and the Index of Eight Core Industries have also observed growth of 5.8 per cent \\nand 8.4 per cent respectively during Q3 of FY24. \\n \\n6. The contribution of the construction sector to overall GVA increased in Q3. A robust \\nincrease in cement and steel production portends well for a sustained rise in construction \\nactivity. Aided by government interventions and increased demand for residential properties in \\ntier-2 and tier-3 cities, the construction sector is capturing new markets. The strong thrust to \\ninfrastructure investment through initiatives like GatiShakti  and National Infrastructure \\npipeline have also raised the demand for construction. \\n \\nThe Indian housing market has witnessed significant growth in sales and new house launches in 2023, \\ndespite increasing home prices and a rise in interest rates on home loans.

The Organisation of Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), in its \\nFebruary 2024 Interim Economic Outlook, forecasts an improvement in global trade in the near \\nfuture. Asia's reviving production of semiconductors and electronics, coupled with a rise \\nin car sales, is providing a much-needed lift to merchandise trade. Meanwhile, the return \\nof air passenger traffic to pre-pandemic levels is fuelling growth in services trade. However, \\nsurvey measures of export orders generally remain modest, particularly in manufacturing, and \\nnew supply disruptions are appearing. Attacks on shipping in the Red Sea have resulted in trade \\nflows being re -routed so that the shipping costs have rise n sharply, and delivery times have \\nlengthened, especially for trade from Asia to Europe. Box 3 examines the impact of the Red \\nSea crisis on the global as well as the Indian economy.  \\n \\n \\nBox 3: Impact of the Red Sea Crisis \\nThe ongoing crisis in the Red Sea shipping route is having an impact on global food prices, \\nwith longer cargo travel distances and higher freight rates potentially leading to an increase \\nin cost.

The average value of the S&P GSCI Industrial \\nMetal Index declined in  April 23 to February 24, driven by a fall in prices of industrial meta ls. The \\nimpact of declining international commodity prices is also reflected in a moderation in core inflation, \\nwhich majorly reflects imported inflation in India.  \\n \\nIndia’s merchandise exports grew by 11.9 per cent in February 2024, the highest monthly export in the \\ncurrent fiscal so far, powered by sectors such as engineering goods, electronics, chemicals, \\npharmaceuticals and petroleum products despite aforementioned adversities. Sectors like engineering \\ngoods, electronics, chemicals, pharmaceuticals, and petroleum products fuelled this growth. \\nMerchandise imports posted a growth of 12.2 per cent in February 2024, widening the trade deficit \\nduring the month to USD 18.7 billion in February 2024 compared to USD 16.6 billion in February 2023. \\nHowever, during April-February 2024, the positive impact of the drop in the value of imports outweighs \\nthe negative impact of a decline in exports, thereby leading to a narrowing of the merchandise trade \\ndeficit. \\n \\n \\n7 The GSCPI integrates a number of commonly used metrics with the aim of providing a comprehensive summary \\nof potential supply chain disruptions.
